                    <p>OCAF calculations are primarily used for Section 8 contract renewals under various HUD programs, including Option 1, Option 2, and Option 4 contract renewals.

                <h3>Why does debt service affect the OCAF calculation?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The OCAF calculation formula separates the portion of rent attributable to debt service from the portion attributable to operating expenses. This is because debt service typically remains constant over time (unless refinanced), while operating expenses are subject to inflation.

                <h3>What is the "Increase Factor" in the OCAF calculation?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The Increase Factor is the final multiplier used to adjust current contract rents to determine new contract rents. It's calculated by dividing the Adjusted Contract Rent Potential by the Annual Expiring Section 8 Contract Rent Potential. This factor represents the overall percentage increase that will be applied to the current contract rents.</p>

                <h3>Do I need to enter non-Section 8 units in the calculator?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, for an accurate calculation, you should enter the annual rent potential for both non-expiring Section 8 contracts and non-Section 8 units. These values are used to determine the expiring Section 8 portion of the total project rent potential, which affects how the debt service is allocated in the calculation.</p>

                <h3>Can I save my calculations for future reference?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, our calculator allows you to export your results as either a PDF or Excel file. This feature lets you save your calculations for record-keeping, sharing with colleagues, or submission to HUD.</p>

                <h3>What if I have multiple Section 8 contracts expiring at different times?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>You should perform separate OCAF calculations for each expiring contract. Our calculator is designed to handle one expiring contract at a time. For contracts expiring at different times, you would include the non-expiring contracts in the "Total Annual Rent Potential For Non-Expiring Section 8 Contracts" field.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, our calculator is regularly updated with the latest OCAF factors as soon as they are published by HUD. The current factors in our calculator are for 2025, effective as of February 11, 2025.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>You should enter the total annual debt service for your property, including principal and interest payments on all mortgages and loans. This amount is used to separate the debt service component from the operating expense component of your rents.</p>
